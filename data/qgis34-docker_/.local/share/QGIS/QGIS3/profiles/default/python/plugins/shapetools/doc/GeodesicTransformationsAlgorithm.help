Geodesically transform a shape. It supports scaling, rotation and translation. The size and geometry of each shape will be retained regardless of the projection.

* Input vector layer - Select an existing point, line, or polygon vector layer.
* Selected features only - Checking this box will cause the algorithm to only transform the selected features.
* Rotation angle about the centroid - Rotate the feature about its centroid. A positive angle rotates in a clockwise direction.
* Scale factor about the centroid - Scale the shape about its centroid. A scale factor of 1 retains its same size.
* Translation distance - Distance the shape will be moved along a geodesic path.
* Translation azimuth - Azimuth or direction the shape will be moved along a geodesic path.
* Translation distance units - Units of distance the shape will be move.
* Output layer - The output layer that will be created in QGIS.
